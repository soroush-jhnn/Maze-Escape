# Maze-Escape
Returns A list of coordinates, from the exit point to the entrance point. The first item on the list is the coordinate of the exit point while the last item is the coordinate of the entrance point.

Question
We have a maze:
| O | O | W | O | O |
| O | E | W | O | O |
| O | W | X | O | O |
| O | O | O | O | O |

E represents the entry; W represents impassible walls and X represents the exit of the maze. Your goal is to write a function "escape", to escape the maze.
Coordinate has the format of (row, column). In this example, the top-left corner has the coordinate of (0, 0), while the bottom-right corner has the coordinate of (3, 4).

Question 1
Write the interface contract as Javadoc in your code. The "return" is given.

Question 2
Follow the given template to implement the "escape" function and corresponding Junit 5 tests.
